            <h2>Filming Begins</h2>
				<p>Ardmore has been home to TV and film productions for over 40 years so optimum productivity is guaranteed. Following its launch in 1958, it played host to such high profile productions as Michael Anderson’s Shake Hands with the Devil in 1959; Francis Ford Coppolla’s Dementia 13 in 1963 and Martin Ritt’s The Spy Who Came in from the Cold in 1965.As part of its large lot, Ardmore boasts five sound stages ranging in area from 3,000 to 23,250 square feet as well as impressive storage facilites and a 4,500 square foot props department.
        The studios are based against the stunning backdrop of county Wicklow and a short drive away from the coastline, mountain ranges, rolling fields and Dublin city. The local infrastructure is well maintained with national roads connecting the studios to Dublin Port and Dublin’s International airport. </p>

            <h2>Production Starts</h2>
		  <p>A major new production of a TV series to be broadcast on Netflix has begun shooting in Troy Studios, Limerick. 

Up to 500 people will be employed during the filming of the Netflix drama, a production that is estimated to be worth up to €70m to the local economy.
"Nightflyers" is based on a novella by Game of Thrones author George RR Martin and began shooting in Limerick earlier this week. 
NBC Universal, through its subsidiary Universal Cable Productions, made the announcement today.
Netflix will co-produce and have first-run rights to the series outside of the US.Executive VP of NBC Universal Kimberly Harris, who was in Dublin today for the launch of the show, said the Government's support of the film and television sector, as well as the skilled local workforce, were the key issues in deciding to film the show here.
Limerick City and County Council bought the old Dell factory after realising its potential following the successful staging of a number of events during the National City of Culture 2014 celebrations and discussions began about converting it into studios.
The facility is one of the four key strategy sites for development as part of the Limerick 2030 plan.
In tandem with the development of the studios, Innovate Limerick and Limerick City and County Council have put in place the supporting services such as a dedicated Film In Limerick and the production and digital skills academy at Engine to develop a supply of skilled people locally to work on future productions.</p>
