            <h2>Genre: Horror</h2>
                                   
			<h4> reviewed by T.Walker 22/2/18</h4>
				<p>One of the most striking images from Get Out is a closeup of British actor Daniel Kaluuya wide-eyed in shock as tears stream down his face. As the $4.5m indie horror evolved this year from buzzed-about Sundance hit to $250m-grossing global phenomenon, this image increasingly became the go-to visual to accompany admiring features and reviews, because it effectively communicates something of the movie’s unsettling nature. (Spoiler: Kaluuya’s tears are not a byproduct of mirth.) Which makes it all the stranger that much of this week has been given over to a wide-ranging discussion as to whether Jordan Peele’s high-tension satirical horror should be classified as a comedy.

It is all because of the baked-in eccentricities of the Golden Globes. The gong-dispensing offshoot of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) essentially hands out two best picture awards every January, one for drama and one for comedy/musical. If Get Out can smuggle itself into the latter category, it arguably has more of a fighting chance: instead of going head-to-head with Christopher Nolan’s war epic Dunkirk, a likely drama frontrunner, it can compete against more modestly budgeted fare such as romcom The Big Sick or tennis tale Battle of the Sexes. Despite being voted on by only 90 international journalists, the Globes are viewed as a bellwether for the Oscars. If Peele’s film can carve out a win, the thinking goes, it might fuel an underdog narrative all the way to the Academy Awards.</p>

            <h2>Genre: Sci-Fi</h2>
			<h4> reviewed by T.Walker 02/12/18</h4>
		  <p>An old hope. A new realism. An old anxiety. A new feeling that the Force might be used to channel erotic telepathy, and long-distance evil seduction. The excitingly and gigantically proportioned eighth film in the great Star Wars saga offers all of these, as well as colossal confrontations, towering indecisions and teetering temptations, spectacular immolations, huge military engagements, and very small disappointments.

The character-driven face-offs are wonderful and the messianic succession crisis about the last Jedi of the title is gripping. But there is a convoluted and slightly unsatisfying parallel plot strand about the Resistance’s strategic military moves as the evil First Order closes in, and an underwritten, under-imagined and eccentrically dressed new character – Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, played by Laura Dern.

More successful is a new figure from other ranks: Kelly Marie Tran is terrifically good as Rose Tico, the Resistance soldier who steps up to meet her destiny as a key player in the battle against tyranny. Like The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi offers variations on the mighty orchestral themes of the original trilogy, switching occasionally to muted tones and minor keys, before cranking the volume back up. This auto-reference has become an accepted and exhilarating part of the new Star Wars rhetoric.</p>

			<h1 class="article-get out">The Dark Knight Rises</h1>
            <h2>Genre: Action</h2>
				<h4> reviewed by T.Walker 22/2/18</h4>
				<p>Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises completes not only his personal trilogy focusing on socialite Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Gotham City's caped crusader, but also a cycle of popular culture that began in May 1939 when Batman was added to Detective Comics' pantheon of superheroes.

Batman's creator Bob Kane and his fellow comic-strip artists were all admirers of Fritz Lang's German movies, the forerunners of film noir, but this did not prevent them from becoming the object of a ferocious assault by Eisenhower-era moralists bent on suppressing horror comics during a crusade led by the psychiatrist Fredric Wertham. His 1954 book, Seduction of the Innocent, attacked Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson's menage as a covert celebration of homosexuality. Ten years later, however, when Susan Sontag's seminal essay Notes on Camp promoted kitsch and the idea of "it's good because it's bad", Batman became a TV series in garish comic-strip colour and was followed by a tongue-in-cheek film version and a revival of the low-budget 1943 Batman serial, all 15 chapters being shown back-to-back to open London's latest super cinema.

            <h1 class="StarWars">Lady Bird</h1>
            <h2>Genre: Comedy/Drama</h2>
			<h4> reviewed by T.Walker 2/2/18</h4>
		  <p>In the conversations that have ushered in its theatrical release, Lady Bird has been described as Greta Gerwig’s directorial debut. Yet, with seven screenplays to her name and a co-director credit on Joe Swanberg’s 2008 mumblecore drama Nights and Weekends, it’s not as though she is new to making movies. Still, the endearing shagginess and goofy imperfection associated with Gerwig’s work in front of and behind the camera are noticeably absent in this polished, muscular, Oscar-nominated debut proper. Not a criticism exactly, but perhaps an explanation for why the film has managed to transcend its indie dramedy trappings.

Set in Sacramento, California in 2002, it centres on Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), a high-schooler who behaves with the unselfconscious conviction of a young kid. She insists she be called by her “given” name of Lady Bird (“It was given to me, by me”), extols the benefits of bathtub masturbation to her best friend Julie while eating communion wafers (“They’re not consecrated!”) and jabs her crush in the shoulder, asking him to dance. Gerwig’s pink-haired protagonist is seemingly unencumbered by the awkwardness and fear that dogs most teenagers on the cusp of change. This cusp-ness is where the film’s magic resides; its joyful, forward-rushing narrative rhythm captures the feeling of adolescence ending before it has barely begun.
